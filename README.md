# S4ConvD

The official implementation of the paper: S4ConvD: Adaptive Scaling and Frequency Adjustment for Energy-Efficient Sensor Networks in Smart Buildings, submitted to TOSN Journal.

# Used Dataset

The ASHRAE - Great Energy Predictor III dataset has been used for this paper: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ashrae-energy-prediction/overview

# Preprocessing

To preprocess the data like it is mentioned in the paper, please use a Jupyter noteboook inside the Kaggle environment and copy the Dataset_preprocessing to create the three distinct datasets train.csv, test.csv and val.csv. After processing you can download all three files from Kaggle and continue to work with the datasets in other environments.
